### Introduction

The Consensus Pipeline After Model Pre-Annotation Task Template automates the evaluation of annotation agreement following a model pre-annotation task. In this pipeline, items are first processed through a model pre-annotation task. After labeling, items enter consensus stages where annotators provide their input to calculate agreement scores based on configurable thresholds. This template supports all media types and integrates seamlessly with Dataloop's labeling workflow and task management systems.

### Installation

There are two options for installing and using the Consensus Pipeline After Model Pre-Annotation Task Template:

**Option 1:**

* Open the Pipelines page on the Dataloop platform and select _**Create Pipeline**_.

**Option 2:**
