# *Text Annotation Workflow*

<img src="assets/pipeline.png" alt="Image of the pipeline">

### Introduction:

This pipeline is designed for a comprehensive text data processing workflow. It begins with a TEXT dataset, which is processed through the PREPROCESS-TEXT node for essential text preprocessing tasks. Following this, the preprocessed data moves to the LABELING task for annotation. After labeling, the data undergoes a QA TASK workflow to ensure the labeled data meets quality standards. This stage includes conditions for either completing the task or discarding data that doesn't meet the criteria.

This pipeline creates clean and annotated text datasets for various AI projects.

### Installation:
