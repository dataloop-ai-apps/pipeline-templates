<img src="assets/pipeline.png" alt="Image of the pipeline">

### Introduction:

This app implements a multi-stage data processing pipeline. It begins with a dataset, moves through a labeling 
workflow, then splits the data, directing a portion to a quality assurance task while the remainder proceeds to the 
final output stage.

This pipeline generates high-quality datasets for AI projects by using data labeling, automated splitting, 
and QA checks. It facilitate the process of creating clean, well-annotated data ready for AI applications.
