### Introduction:

This template creates the process of converting pdf items to text and image files. 
Each file is generated for a specific chunk of data. 
The text files undergo preprocessing using cleaning functions provided by the `UnstructuredIO` library.

The processed text and image files are then stored in the target dataset, 
making them suitable for multimodal workflows involving language models, vision models, or hybrid systems that operate on both text and visual inputs.

### Installation:

There are two options for installing and using the template:

1. Pipelines:

* Open the pipelines page and select Create Pipeline.
* Select Use a Template from the dropdown list.
