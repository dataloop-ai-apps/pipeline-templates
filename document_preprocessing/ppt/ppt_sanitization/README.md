# *PPT Sanitization Detection Pipeline Template*

![Image of the pipeline](./assets/pipeline-view.png)

### Introduction:

This template application creates a pipeline flow that takes .pptx files as inputs and passes it through two nodes: one 
performs NER and replaces named entities such as locations, people, organization, etc. by tags; and a second node 
removes visual identifiers from the presentation. The final result is a ppt file with a neutral white background with 
black text 

### Installation:

There are two options for installing and using the template:

1. Pipelines:

* Open the pipelines page and select Create Pipeline.
* Select Use a Template from the dropdown list.
*
