### Introduction:

This template streamlines the process of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) by leveraging multiple Language 
Model (LLM) models. The outputs from these models are routed through a consensus node, where approved results proceed 
to the next stage of the AI-driven process, while rejected outcomes are directed to a labeling task for further 
refinement.

### Installation:

In order to use the template, you need to follow these steps:

* Open the pipelines page and select Create Pipeline.
* Select Use a Template from the dropdown list.
